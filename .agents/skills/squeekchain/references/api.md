# API

> Squeekchain HTTP APIs: public measurement, settlement, economy and NFT data, plus authenticated Community Sepolia mint status and authorizations.

Web version: https://docs.squeekchain.com/developers/api/

## TL;DR

- `GET https://api.squeekchain.com/v1/…` serves public measurement and chain data without an API key.
- Authenticated Community endpoints use a bearer session.
- A response can say `"status": "unavailable"` with HTTP 200, which means unknown, not empty or zero.
- Use the API to display and explore. Read the contracts before preparing any transaction.

!!! warning "In active development"

    Validate responses against the published schemas and handle unknown fields.

## Base URL and access

```text
https://api.squeekchain.com
```

Public reads are bodyless `GET` requests under `/v1` and need no API key. Authenticated Community endpoints use a separate origin and a bearer session. Identify Sepolia contracts from the [deployment record](overview.md#deployments), not an API response.

Call it from a server, script or agent; browsers on any site can call the public reads too (`Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`, no credentials).

For monitoring, `GET /healthz` answers 200 while the API runs, and `GET /readyz` answers 200 only while its database is reachable.

## Conventions

These conventions apply to public read endpoints; [Community mint](api.md#community-mint) defines its own request, caching and error rules.

### Numbers and units

Large numbers (IDs, amounts, block numbers and work) are decimal strings. Parse them as `BigInt` or your language's big-integer type, never as floating point. Small values such as levels and speeds are plain JSON integers.

Field names carry their unit, as listed below.

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Field names and units</summary>

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `…BaseUnits`, `supplyCap` | $SQK with 18 decimals: `1000000000000000000` is 1 $SQK |
| `basePower`, `nftPower`, `sqkPower`, `targetPower` | [Power](staking.md#account-power) |
| `blockHeight`, `coreBlockHeight`, `height`, `…CompletedBlock`, `nextMergeHeight`, `closedThroughBlock` | Squeek block numbers, not Ethereum blocks |
| `blockProgress`, `cumulativeBlockUnits` | Block units: 1,000,000,000 make one Squeek block |
| `workPerThousandBlocks` | Difficulty: work units needed for 1,000 Squeek blocks; see [SqueekCore](core.md#state) |
| `cumulativeWork`, `workUnits`, `cumulativeWorkUnits`, `workThreshold` | Wheel work units |
| `…Round`, `roundId` | 600-second rounds counted from the genesis timestamp |
| `ethereumBlockNumber`, `blockNumber`, `chain.…Block` | Ethereum block numbers |
| `…At`, `blockTimestamp` | ISO 8601 times in UTC; `/v1/core` timestamps and mint `deadline` use Unix seconds |
| `date`, `utcDate` | `YYYY-MM-DD` |
| `…Bps` | Basis points, 0–10,000 |
| `…Milli` | Thousandths: `12500` is 12.5 |
| `…Ms`, `…Ns` | Milliseconds, nanoseconds |
| `rpmMilli`, `speedMmPerSecond`, `distanceMm` | Thousandths of a revolution per minute, millimetres per second, millimetres |

</details>

### Chain data

Everything read from Ethereum is pinned 12 blocks behind the chain tip. The `chain` object names the block a response was read at; compare `safeThroughBlock`, not `generatedAt`, to tell whether the chain has moved.

`release` and `deployment` identify the economy contracts a response was read from; `/v1/core` uses `identities`. Check the release, component pins and capability evaluation block against [Deployments](overview.md#deployments) before relying on a response.

### Availability

Most responses have a `status`. When it's `"unavailable"`, the response carries a `reason` and no data, with HTTP 200; show it as unknown, never as zero or empty. The one exception is the economy overload response described under [Errors](api.md#errors), which uses HTTP 503.

### Caching

Cloudflare shares responses across callers for the endpoint's `s-maxage`, so faster polling returns the same data. Send an endpoint's `ETag` back unchanged in `If-None-Match`; unchanged content returns 304 with no body and may keep an earlier `generatedAt`. Errors are never shared.

| Endpoint | Shared for | Conditional requests |
|---|---|---|
| [Pipeline status](api.md#status) | 1 second | Yes |
| [SqueekCore state](api.md#core), [Event feed](api.md#events), [Economy state](api.md#economy-state), [Settlement history](api.md#settlements) without `range`, an available [Squeek](api.md#squeek) | 5 seconds | Yes |
| [Measurement statistics](api.md#measurement-stats), [Settlement history](api.md#settlements) with a `range` | 60 seconds | Yes |
| [Measurement runs](api.md#measurement-runs), [Provisional blocks](api.md#measurement-blocks), [Account](api.md#account) endpoints, an unavailable [Squeek](api.md#squeek) | Never stored (`no-store`) | No |

### Pagination

List endpoints return up to `limit` items (1–100) and a `nextCursor`. Pass that opaque value as `cursor` for the next page; `null` marks the last page. Restart from the first page after 400 `invalid_cursor` or 409 `cursor_invalidated`.

| Endpoint | Default `limit` |
|---|---|
| [Event feed](api.md#events) | 40 |
| [Account](api.md#account), [Account activity](api.md#account-activity) | 25 |
| [Measurement runs](api.md#measurement-runs) | 20 |

### Rate limits

Each IP address has a request budget per endpoint class. Over budget, the API answers 429 with a `Retry-After` header; wait that many seconds before retrying.

| Class | Endpoints | Rate | Burst |
|---|---|---|---|
| `publicFast` | [Pipeline status](api.md#status), [SqueekCore state](api.md#core), [Economy state](api.md#economy-state) | 30 per second | 60 |
| `publicHeavy` | [Measurement statistics](api.md#measurement-stats), [Settlement history](api.md#settlements), [Event feed](api.md#events), [Account](api.md#account), [Account activity](api.md#account-activity) | 5 per second | 20 |
| `metadata` | [Squeek](api.md#squeek) | 20 per second | 40 |
| `observations` | [Measurement runs](api.md#measurement-runs), [Provisional blocks](api.md#measurement-blocks) | 2 per second | 4 |

### Headers

| Header | Use |
|---|---|
| `X-Request-Id` | On every response. Send your own (8–128 letters, digits, `.`, `_`, `:` or `-`) to trace a request, and quote it when reporting a problem |
| `ETag` | On status, statistics, settlement history, SqueekCore state, event feed, economy state and available Squeek responses; send it back as `If-None-Match`. See [Caching](api.md#caching) |
| `Retry-After` | On 429 and 503 responses: seconds to wait before retrying |
| `X-Squeek-Settlement-Source` | On [Settlement history](api.md#settlements): `live`, `durable-cache` or `unavailable` |
| `X-Squeek-Settlement-Fallback-Reason` | On [Settlement history](api.md#settlements), only with `durable-cache`: why the cached snapshot was served (`indexer_disabled`, `not_yet_safe`, `indexer_unavailable` or `indexer_mismatch`) |

### Versioning and schemas

Public read paths stay `/v1`, and the response's `schemaVersion` identifies the wire contract: version 4 for events, version 3 for economy state, account, account activity and Squeek. Check it before reading a response. Community mint has its own strict versioned contract and no `schemaVersion` field.

Validate responses against the linked JSON Schemas (draft 2020-12) with the `date`, `date-time` and `uuid` formats enabled. Treat `uint…-decimal` values as unsigned decimal strings. Examples are illustrative and may be shortened; they aren't live state or deployment evidence. When one shows `unavailable`, the field table describes the available response.

## Errors

Public read errors return an HTTP status and `{"error": "<code>"}`, except the economy overload response below. The codes below can come from public endpoints; Community mint has its own [error table](api.md#community-mint-errors).

| Status | Code | Meaning | What to do |
|---|---|---|---|
| 400 | `invalid_query` | A parameter is missing, malformed, repeated or unknown | Fix the request |
| 404 | `not_found` | No such endpoint | Check the path |
| 429 | `rate_limited` | Over the rate limit | Wait `Retry-After` seconds |
| 503 | `database_busy`, `indexer_busy`, `database_unavailable` | The API is overloaded or a dependency is down | Wait `Retry-After` seconds, then retry with backoff |
| 504 | `request_timeout` | The request took too long | Retry with backoff |
| 500 | `internal_error` | Unexpected server failure | Retry a few times; report the `X-Request-Id` |

Two overload responses look different:

- **`indexer_busy`**: the API is already running its maximum number of Indexer reads. It answers 503 `` with `Retry-After: 2` and `Cache-Control: no-store`.
- **Economy overload**: the Indexer itself is overloaded while serving [economy state](api.md#economy-state), an [account](api.md#account), [account activity](api.md#account-activity) or a [Squeek](api.md#squeek). The API answers HTTP 503 with `Retry-After: 1`, `Cache-Control: no-store` and an unavailable body in that endpoint's shape, `status: "unavailable"` with `reason: "indexer_unavailable"`, instead of an error code.

Retry both after `Retry-After` seconds. Branch on the HTTP status, not the body alone: the economy overload body matches an ordinary unavailable response.

A response that doesn't parse or doesn't match its schema is an error, not empty data.

## API or contracts?

Use the API, an indexed and confirmation-delayed view, for display, history and exploration. Before preparing a transaction, read the contracts at a block you choose.

| You want to | Use |
|---|---|
| Show whether the wheel is running and how far the next block is | [`/v1/status`](api.md#status) |
| Chart wheel activity, records and settlement performance | [`/v1/measurement/stats`](api.md#measurement-stats) |
| Show settled work, block height and difficulty | [`/v1/core`](api.md#core); for an exact value at a block, [SqueekCore `state()`](core.md#state) |
| List settlements and $SQK issued per period | [`/v1/settlements`](api.md#settlements); to rebuild history yourself, [Index events](index-events.md) |
| Show a feed of what happened | [`/v1/events`](api.md#events) |
| Show $SQK supply, issuance and staking totals | [`/v1/economy/state`](api.md#economy-state) |
| Show an account's Squeeks, power and $SQK | [`/v1/accounts/{address}`](api.md#account) |
| Prepare a rewards claim or merge | The contracts: [Build owner actions](owner-actions.md). Read current balances and eligibility onchain |
| Show a Squeek's image and traits | [`/v1/squeeks/{tokenId}`](api.md#squeek); onchain, [`tokenURI`](nft.md#tokenuri) |

## Measurement and validation

What the WHEELY9000 measured, how the Oracle validated it, and how close the next Squeek block is.
### Pipeline status · GET /v1/status

The whole pipeline's live state in one read: the latest accepted measurement, the block builder's projection, Oracle validation, the settlement queue and the device signer. Poll it to show whether the wheel is turning and how close the next block is.

The endpoint takes no parameters; any query parameter returns 400 `invalid_query`.

[Complete response schema](api/status.json)

Projected values are optimistic: a projected completed block isn't settled on Ethereum and hasn't issued $SQK. It settles when the Reporter's batch confirms, and issues $SQK when SqueekMining checkpoints it.

**Freshness**

A shared snapshot is recomputed at most once a second and right after each accepted measurement. Builder unavailable reasons: `no_measurement`, `counter_fault`, `counter_epoch_unapproved`, `round_projection_gap`, `oracle_head_unavailable`, `round_ineligible`. Oracle reasons: `no_measurement`, `counter_fault`, `counter_epoch_unapproved`, `round_projection_gap`, `oracle_head_unavailable`. Queue unavailable reasons: `oracle_head_unavailable`, `round_projection_gap`, `round_ineligible`. A stale measurement alone doesn't make the builder unavailable.

### Measurement runs · GET /v1/measurement/runs

The device's record of wheel passages, grouped into immutable run segments with exact passage times, for animating or analysing running sessions. It's evidence signed by the device's key, not work certified by SqueekCore.

**Query parameters**

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `limit` | `integer` | No | Segments per page, 1–100; default 20. Above 100 returns 400 `invalid_limit` |
| `cursor` | `string` | No | `nextCursor` from the previous page |

### Provisional blocks · GET /v1/measurement/blocks

The Squeek blocks the wheel's accepted work has completed beyond the settled frontier, each with its completing work threshold and, when known, the exact passage that crossed it. Use it to show blocks as they happen, then confirm each against SqueekCore when it settles.

The endpoint takes no parameters; any query parameter returns 400 `invalid_query`.

Provisional blocks aren't settled and have issued no $SQK. Reveal each one once, then compare its work and round with SqueekCore when it settles; a mismatch stops the settlement, and the block is never drawn again.

**Freshness**

Read on every request and never stored by caches. Missing, gapped or unhealthy measurement, an open settlement incident, stale telemetry, or more than 120 blocks of lead give `unavailable` instead of a partial list. Unavailable reasons: `no_measurement`, `counter_fault`, `counter_epoch_unapproved`, `round_projection_gap`, `oracle_head_unavailable`, `round_ineligible`, `stale_measurement`, `unhealthy_measurement`, `unhealthy_settlement`, `projection_lead_exceeded`, `projection_inconsistent`.

### Measurement statistics · GET /v1/measurement/stats

Aggregates over the last 7 or 30 days: lifetime totals, daily and half-hourly activity, records, block production, round activity and settlement performance. Use it for charts and summaries; it's too heavy to poll.

**Query parameters**

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |

The `24h` window ends at the next full hour; the `7d` and `30d` windows end at the next 12:00 UTC, so buckets shift on those boundaries even without new events. The response header `X-Squeek-Settlement-Source` is `live`, `durable-cache` (the indexer is behind or unavailable and the last good snapshot is served) or `unavailable`. With `durable-cache`, `X-Squeek-Settlement-Fallback-Reason` gives the reason the live read wasn't used, from the unavailable reasons below. Unavailable reasons: `indexer_disabled`, `not_yet_safe`, `indexer_unavailable`, `indexer_mismatch`.

### Event feed · GET /v1/events

The newest-first feed of what happened: settlements and checkpoints, account rewards and staking, Squeek deposits, withdrawals and merges, and wheel milestones. Use it for an activity feed.

**Query parameters**

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `category` | `string` | No | `all` (default), `protocol`, `players` or `measurement` |
| `limit` | `integer` | No | 1–100; default 40 |

**Example request**

```sh
curl -i "https://api.squeekchain.com/v1/events?category=all&limit=40"

[Complete response schema](api/events.json)

The schema also lists `measurement.rpm_record`, which this endpoint never returns. Days for measurement events run from 12:00 UTC to 12:00 UTC.

**Freshness**

Chain events appear once they have 12 confirmations; measurement events once the measurement is accepted. Shared for up to 5 seconds. Unavailable reasons: `indexer_disabled`, `not_yet_safe`, `indexer_unavailable`, `indexer_mismatch`, `source_disabled`.

**Errors**

|---|---|---|
| 400 | `invalid_cursor` | The cursor can't be decoded or was issued for another category; start again from the first page |
| 400 | `invalid_query` | Also returned for a cursor containing characters other than `A–Z a–z 0–9 _ -` |

## Economy and Squeeks

$SQK supply, issuance and staking, each account's Squeeks, power and rewards, its history, and each Squeek's state and metadata.

These version-3 endpoints share a release envelope with version-4 events: `release` names the release, `chain` the safe block, `deployment` the revisioned component descriptor, and `capabilities` their readback at that block. A missing component is `null` in the descriptor. Keep absent, configured, unavailable and mismatched capabilities distinct, and never turn an unknown component into a zero balance. The descriptor's dispenser is the Sepolia authorization minter.

A response from another deployment is `unavailable` with `indexer_mismatch`, never served from a stale copy. Other unavailable reasons are `indexer_disabled`, `not_yet_safe`, `indexer_unavailable`, `unsupported_contract_version` and `projection_rebuilding`. Wallet NFT data can stay available without monetary components.

### Economy state · GET /v1/economy/state

The whole economy at the safe block: $SQK supply and issuance, mining lifecycle and funding, staking totals, and the Squeek level tables. Use it for supply figures and economy dashboards.

The endpoint takes no parameters; any query parameter returns 400 `invalid_query`.

**Example request**

```sh
curl -i https://api.squeekchain.com/v1/economy/state
```

### Account · GET /v1/accounts/{address}

One account at the safe block: its rewards, power, staked $SQK, recent earnings and a page of its Squeeks, held in the wallet or deposited in staking. Use it for an account or portfolio view.

**Path and query parameters**

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `address` | `string` | Yes | The account: `0x` and 40 hex digits, all lowercase or with a valid EIP-55 checksum. Anything else, including a wrong checksum or the zero address, returns 400 `invalid_address`. The response gives it lowercase |

[Complete response schema](api/account.json)

Without verified Staking, `rewards`, `power`, `stake`, `earnings` and token `basePower` are null rather than zero. `tokenCounts.staking` is zero for absent Staking and null for unverified Staking. `claimRecipient: null` means self-payment only when Staking is verified.

## Community mint

Community mint runs on a separate Community origin, not the public API, and requires a signed-in, non-disqualified account. Set `COMMUNITY_BASE_URL=https://community.squeekchain.com` and send `Authorization: Bearer <session-token>` on both requests. The session identifies the person, not a wallet address; keep the token private and don't cache account responses.

### Mint status · GET /v1/community/mint/status

Read the signed-in person's tier, lifetime allowance, claimed quantity, available quantity and any reusable authorization.

**Request**

```sh
curl -i "${COMMUNITY_BASE_URL}/v1/community/mint/status" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ${COMMUNITY_SESSION_TOKEN}"
```

**Parameters**

No path parameters or request body. A bearer Community session is required.

**Response**

HTTP 200, [complete response schema](api/community-mint-status.json):

```json
{
  "tier": "none",
  "allowance": 1,
  "claimed": 0,
  "available": 1,
  "recipient": null,
  "claimsOpen": true,
  "authorization": null
}
```

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `tier` | `string` | `gold`, `silver`, `bronze`, `member` or `none` |
| `allowance` | `integer` | Cumulative lifetime allowance for the current tier |
| `claimed` | `integer` | NFTs delivered onchain across all five person/tier authorization IDs |
| `available` | `integer` | `max(0, allowance - claimed)` |
| `recipient` | `string` or `null` | Lowercase eligible wallet address; null when no linked wallet qualifies |
| `claimsOpen` | `boolean` | False when the minter's claims are closed or its onchain `signer()` differs from this service's signing address; not a promise that the person has an eligible wallet or quantity left |
| `authorization` | `object` or `null` | Issued, unexpired, unconsumed authorization; same fields as POST except no `tier` inside this object |

**Freshness and unavailable states**

`Cache-Control: no-store`. Re-read after a claim, wallet change or tier change. An authorization is not an onchain delivery: only the `Claimed` event increases `claimed`. No eligible wallet is represented by a null recipient, not a zero address.

**Errors**

Bearer failures return 401 `unauthorized`; missing deployment or signer configuration returns 503 `mint_not_configured`. Closed claims or a signer mismatch still return HTTP 200, with `claimsOpen: false` and `authorization: null`; only [Mint authorization](api.md#community-mint-authorization) answers them with 503 `mint_unavailable`. A failed chain read returns 503 `mint_unavailable`. GET allows 60 requests per person per minute; over that, it returns 429 `rate_limited` with `Retry-After`. See [Community mint errors](api.md#community-mint-errors).

### Mint authorization · POST /v1/community/mint/authorization

Request the server-signed authorization for the current person and tier. POST does not send an Ethereum transaction.

**Request**

```sh
curl -i "${COMMUNITY_BASE_URL}/v1/community/mint/authorization" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ${COMMUNITY_SESSION_TOKEN}" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --data '{}'
```

**Parameters**

The body must be exactly the empty JSON object `{}`; unknown fields are rejected by the [strict request schema](api/community-mint-request.json). No wallet, quantity, tier, chain or deadline input is accepted.

**Response**

HTTP 200, [complete response schema](api/community-mint-authorization.json). This illustrative shape uses a synthetic signature and ID and isn't a usable authorization; the recipient address doesn't imply Community membership or wallet eligibility.

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `chainId` | `integer` | Positive chain ID; this service signs for Sepolia, 11155111 |
| `authMinter` | `string` | Lowercase 20-byte address of the descriptor's authorization minter |
| `recipient` | `string` | Lowercase 20-byte Sepolia-eligible wallet selected by the server |
| `quantity` | `integer` | `min(available, 20)`; schema and contract require 1–20 |
| `authorizationId` | `string` | `0x` plus 64 lowercase hex digits; deterministic per person/tier and single-use onchain |
| `deadline` | `string` | Positive decimal Unix seconds, issued as now plus five minutes |
| `expiresAt` | `string` | Offset-bearing ISO 8601 expiration corresponding to `deadline` |
| `signature` | `string` | `0x` plus 130 lowercase hex digits: a 65-byte ECDSA signature by the minter's configured signer |
| `tier` | `string` | `gold`, `silver`, `bronze`, `member` or `none`; outside the signed claim arguments |

**Freshness and unavailable states**

If an issued authorization is unexpired and not consumed onchain, POST returns it again instead of issuing another; resubmit it unchanged. Otherwise the server signs the available quantity under the current tier's ID, and an already-consumed current-tier ID returns `nothing_to_claim` even if the arithmetic available amount is positive. Expiry doesn't consume an ID; a successful onchain claim does.

Use `@sqk/chain/mint-authorization` (`mintAuthorizationTypedData`, `mintAuthorizationDigest`, `accountAuthorizationId`) rather than recreating EIP-712 encoding. Check the chain, descriptor's minter, recipient, expiry and current onchain `signer()`, `claimsOpen()`, `authorizationConsumed(authorizationId)` and `remaining()`. Prepare and simulate `claim(recipient, quantity, authorizationId, deadline, signature)` using `squeekAuthMinterAbi` from `@sqk/chain/auth-minter`, then let the wallet sign and submit. Parse `deadline` as a bigint. The server signature authorizes the mint; it does not replace the wallet's transaction signature.

**Errors**

POST allows three requests per person per ten minutes. A 429 includes `Retry-After`; wait before retrying, including when asking for the same reusable authorization. Wallet, allowance and configuration failures use the table below.

#### Community mint errors

Errors use the [Community error schema](api/community-error.json): `{"error": "<code>"}`. They do not use public-read `status: "unavailable"` bodies.

| Status | Code | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| 400 | `invalid_request` | Request body does not match the strict empty-object contract |
| 401 | `unauthorized` | No valid bearer session |
| 409 | `mint_wallet_unavailable` | No linked wallet can receive on Sepolia |
| 409 | `nothing_to_claim` | No available quantity, or the current tier's authorization ID is already consumed |
| 429 | `rate_limited` | Person-level budget exceeded (GET 60 per minute, POST three per ten minutes); wait the `Retry-After` seconds |
| 503 | `mint_not_configured` | Deployment descriptor or authorization signer is not configured |
| 503 | `mint_unavailable` | The chain read failed; on POST also when claims are closed or the configured signing address differs from onchain `signer()` (GET reports those as `claimsOpen: false`) |

Only non-disqualified accounts are eligible; don't infer eligibility from tier or wallet ownership alone.
